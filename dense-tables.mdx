### Dense Tables

Cardinal automatically detects and processes **dense tables** — cases where a document contains many small-text tables that are difficult to parse cleanly with normal extraction.  

Results are always returned under the **`processed_tables`** field, without requiring additional flags.  

For each table, you’ll receive:  

- **`table_index`** – index of the table on the page.  
- **`page_number`** – page where the table appears.  
- **`bounding_box`** – normalized geometry including `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, plus row/column counts and polygon coordinates.  
- **`row_count` / `column_count`** – detected table dimensions.  
- **`image_format`** – output crop format (e.g. `png`).  
- **`crop_coordinates`** – pixel coordinates for cropped table images.  
- **`dpi_x` / `dpi_y`** – resolution used for rendering.  
- **`text_content`** – extracted HTML/Markdown table text.  
- **`html_code`** – cleaned HTML version of the table (when available).

### Why Dense Tables?

Some engineering, financial, and architectural documents contain dozens of tiny tables (e.g., schedules, parts lists, cell plans).
These tables often break normal Markdown extraction. With processed_tables, you get both:
- Cropped table images for visual reference.
- Normalized bounding boxes for precise placement.
- Extracted HTML/Markdown text for structured parsing.

<Note> Dense table extraction is always included automatically in the JSON output under `processed_tables`. No additional configuration is needed. </Note>
