By default, Cardinal collects anonymized logs for product improvement.  
If you need to **disable** collection for your deployment, contact **team@trycardinal.ai**.

## Using the Loki protocol to forward logs to your own aggregation

The `cardinal` container supports forwarding logs via the **Loki** protocol.  
To enable this, contact support so we can toggle the feature for your instance, and provide the `LOKI_URL` environment variable in your runtime.

> `LOKI_URL` should point to a Loki-compatible push endpoint, e.g. `https://my-internal-loki-service/loki/api/v1/push`.

### Example (Docker Compose)

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: cardinal:latest
    container_name: cardinal
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"   # Web UI
      - "4000:4000"   # API
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/16/main
    environment:
      - CARDINAL_PRODUCT_KEY="12345"
      - LOKI_URL=https://my-internal-loki-service/loki/api/v1/push

volumes:
  pgdata:
    name: cardinal_pg_data
