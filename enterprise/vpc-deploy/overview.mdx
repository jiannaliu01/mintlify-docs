Cardinal Enterprise gives you two ways to run in your own cloud environment:

- **Cardinal Dedicated**  
- **Private Cloud Deployment** 

---

## Cardinal Dedicated

Cardinal Dedicated is a **single-tenant, fully managed** deployment:

- Hosted and operated by Cardinal  
- Deployed on GCP in a cloud region of your choice

Cardinal Dedicated removes the overhead of platform management while allowing for fully isolated deployments. Each Cardinal Dedicated instance is highly available with disaster recovery and deployed into the cloud region of your choice.

The Cardinal team fully manages the maintenance and operations of each isolated instance, so customers can access our latest product improvements while meeting the most complex compliance standards. Administers from your organization are granted IAM roles to monitor the application while Cardinal manages the underlying infrastructure.

---

## Private Cloud Deployment

Private Cloud lets you **self-host Cardinal** within your cloud infrastructure.
