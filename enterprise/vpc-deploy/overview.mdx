Cardinal Enterprise gives you two ways to run in your own cloud environment:

- **Cardinal Dedicated** – fully managed, single-tenant deployment in a VPC we host for you.  
- **Private Cloud Deployment** – self-managed deployment in your own cloud account or data center.

---

## Cardinal Dedicated

Cardinal Dedicated is a **single-tenant, fully managed** deployment:

- Hosted and operated by Cardinal  
- Isolated in a separate AWS/Azure account + VPC  
- Meets enterprise-grade compliance and audit standards  
- Continuous rolling upgrades (one version behind latest Cardinal)  
- IAM roles for your admins; Cardinal manages underlying infra  

---

## Private Cloud Deployment

Private Cloud lets you **self-host Cardinal** within your infrastructure:

- Run Cardinal packages (Server, App, Postgres) inside your own cluster or VMs  
- Bring your own cloud provider, region, or on-prem environment  
- You manage upgrades, scaling, and monitoring  
- Cardinal provides container images and setup docs  

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose (or Kubernetes)  
- Private container registry (ECR/ACR/GCR or equivalent)  
- Credentials for registry access  
- Database user with permissions
