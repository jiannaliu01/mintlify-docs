### Redlines (available upon request)

Cardinal supports **redline detection**, which identifies and extracts markup such as insertions, deletions, or tracked changes in documents.  

⚠️ This feature is **not generally available** — please **contact us to enable redlines** for your account.  

---

### Performance Note

- Redline detection requires an additional processing pass.  
- Enabling it will **increase latency** compared to standard extraction.

<Note>
Redlines are **available upon request only**. If you need access, please reach out to our team.
