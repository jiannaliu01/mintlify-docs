# JSON Extraction

Most teams think of JSON purely as a way to **extract** fields from documents. That’s powerful—but it’s only the start. With Cardinal, JSON is also how you **query** documents for judgment calls (quality checks, routing, classification) and drive **automations** downstream.

Below are three common patterns, each with a short schema you can adopt.

---

## 1) Extract Data (the classic use case)

Pull precise fields from invoices, contracts, forms, and more. Use strict keys so outputs are machine-reliable.

```json
{
  "invoice_data": {
    "invoice_number": "string",
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "vendor_name": "string",
    "total_amount": "number",
    "line_items": [
      {
        "description": "string",
        "quantity": "number",
        "unit_price": "number",
        "total": "number"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**When to use:** analytics, exports to your ERP/CRM, reconciliation, payables workflows.

## 2) Classify Documents (route and prioritize)

JSON isn’t just values—it’s **decisions**. Ask the model to identify the document type, urgency, and where it should go next.

```json
{
  "document_analysis": {
    "document_type": "string - invoice, contract, receipt, etc.",
    "urgency_level": "string - low, medium, high",
    "suggested_department": "string - accounting, legal, HR, etc.",
    "confidence_score": "number (0-1)"
  }
}
```

**When to use:** inbox triage, queue assignment, SLAs, “who should handle this?” automation.

---

## 3) Query Document Quality (gate before downstream)

Before you extract, ask: **is the document even usable?** Encode quality checks as JSON so you can reprocess or flag early.

**Use cases**
- Quality control for scanned documents  
- Determine if images need enhancement  
- Flag documents requiring manual review  
- Automate accept/reject workflows

```json
{
  "document_quality": {
    "is_blurry": "boolean",
    "is_readable": "boolean",
    "image_quality_score": "number (1-10)",
    "recommendation": "string - should this document be reprocessed?"
  }
}
```

**When to use:** scan pipelines, OCR fallback, human-in-the-loop gating.

## Takeaways

- **Extract** to structure data.  
- **Classify** to route and prioritize.  
- **Query** to assess quality and control flow.  

Design your JSON schemas around the decisions you need to automate—not just the fields you need to capture. This turns your document pipeline from “parse and hope” into a predictable, auditable system.
