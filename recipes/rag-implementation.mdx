## What is a Knowledge Base?

A knowledge base is a centralized hub for all of a company’s information. It helps new employees get up to speed faster, reduces time spent searching for answers, and acts like an expert assistant that can quickly respond to any question.

## How Cardinal Powers Intelligent Knowledge Bases

Cardinal makes knowledge bases smarter and more reliable by:

- **Extracting text with high accuracy** – from any document across the company, ensuring nothing is missed.
- **Providing bounding boxes for every piece of data** – so information is fully traceable and easy to cite back to the original source.
- **Semantic chunking** - structuring content into meaningful sections, making it easier for knowledge bases to index, search, and retrieve with precision

## Building Your Knowledge Base: A Step-by-Step Guide

### Phase 1: Document Collection and Processing

Start by identifying and processing your key documents with Cardinal's intelligent chunking system.

```python
import requests

# Process documents with Cardinal
response = requests.post(
    "https://api.trycardinal.ai/process",
    headers={
        "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json={
        "fileUrl": "https://example.com/employee-handbook.pdf",
        "showBoundingBox": True
    }
)

# Extract text content from bounding boxes
processed_chunks = []
for page in response.json()["pages"]:
    for bbox in page["bounding_boxes"]:
        processed_chunks.append({
            "content": bbox["content"],
            "page": page["page"],
            "bounding_box": bbox["bounding_box"]
        })

# Each chunk contains structured, searchable content with location data
```

### Phase 2: Create Semantic Search Capabilities

Convert your processed content into searchable embeddings using advanced AI models.

```python
import voyageai

client = voyageai.Client(api_key="YOUR_VOYAGE_API_KEY")

# Generate embeddings optimized for search
knowledge_base_entries = []
for chunk in processed_chunks:
    embedding = client.embed(
        texts=[chunk["content"]],
        model="voyage-large-2"
    ).embeddings[0]
    
    knowledge_base_entries.append({
        "id": chunk["chunk_id"],
        "content": chunk["content"],
        "embedding": embedding,
        "metadata": {
            "document": chunk["metadata"]["document_name"],
            "section": chunk["metadata"]["section"],
            "page": chunk["metadata"]["page"]
        }
    })
```

### Phase 3: Deploy Intelligent Search

Store your knowledge base in a vector database for fast, accurate retrieval.

```python
from pinecone import Pinecone

# Set up your knowledge base storage
pc = Pinecone(api_key="YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY")
index = pc.Index("company-knowledge-base")

# Upload your knowledge base
vectors = [{
    "id": entry["id"],
    "values": entry["embedding"],
    "metadata": {
        "content": entry["content"],
        "document": entry["metadata"]["document"],
        "section": entry["metadata"]["section"]
    }
} for entry in knowledge_base_entries]

index.upsert(vectors=vectors)
```

### Phase 4: Enable Natural Language Queries

Create an interface that understands user questions and provides accurate answers.

```python
def ask_knowledge_base(question):
    # Convert question to searchable format
    query_embedding = client.embed([question]).embeddings[0]
    
    # Find relevant information
    results = index.query(
        vector=query_embedding,
        top_k=3,
        include_metadata=True
    )
    
    # Extract context for answer generation
    context = "\n\n".join([
        match.metadata["content"] 
        for match in results.matches 
        if match.score > 0.7  # Only high-confidence matches
    ])
    
    return context

# Example usage
answer_context = ask_knowledge_base("What is our vacation policy?")
```

## Success Strategies

### Start Small, Scale Smart
- Begin with your most frequently asked questions
- Focus on high-value documents first
- Gather user feedback and iterate quickly
- Expand coverage based on actual usage patterns

### Maintain Quality
- Regular content audits and updates
- Monitor search accuracy and user satisfaction
- Implement feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Track metrics like search success rates and user engagement

### Drive Adoption
- Train users on effective search techniques
- Integrate with existing workflows and tools
- Promote success stories and time savings
- Make the knowledge base the go-to resource for information

### Measure Impact
Track key metrics to demonstrate value:
- **Search success rate**: Percentage of queries that find relevant results
- **Time to information**: How quickly users find what they need
- **Ticket deflection**: Reduction in support requests
- **User satisfaction**: Quality ratings for search results
