### Latency Overview

Cardinal is optimized for speed and scale. Each page typically takes **around 30 seconds** to process, regardless of size or complexity. Because all pages are processed **in parallel with no rate limits**, total latency depends primarily on the slowest page rather than the total number of pages.

### Typical Latency

| Document Size | Expected Latency |
|---------------|------------------|
| **1 page**    | ~30 sec          |
| **10 pages**  | ~30 sec          |
| **100 pages** | ~30 sec          |
| **1000 pages**| ~30 sec          |

### Notes

- Pages run **fully in parallel**, so overall latency does **not** scale linearly with page count.  
- Complex cases (dense tables, handwriting, annotations, advanced passes) may take closer to **40–50 seconds per page**, but still parallelize.  
- **Post-processing and additional key features** (e.g., bounding boxes, enrichment, or schema alignment) typically add **~15–30 seconds** on top of base latency.  
- There are **no rate limits** — you can process as many pages as you want simultaneously.  
- Skew correction and other advanced passes may add a few seconds of processing time per page.

These are approximate numbers. For production workloads, we recommend uploading a sample batch to benchmark your own latency.
