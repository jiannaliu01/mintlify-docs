### Latency Overview

Cardinal is optimized for speed and scale. Each page typically takes **around 15 seconds** to process with our base model, regardless of size or complexity. Because all pages are processed **in parallel with no rate limits**, total latency depends primarily on the slowest page rather than the total number of pages.

### Typical Latency

| Document Size | Expected Latency |
|---------------|------------------|
| **1 page**    | ~15 sec          |
| **10 pages**  | ~15 sec          |
| **100 pages** | ~15 sec          |
| **1000 pages**| ~15 sec          |

### Notes

- Pages run **fully in parallel**, so overall latency does **not** scale linearly with page count.  
- **Base model processing** takes approximately **15 seconds per page** for standard OCR.
- **Additional features** can increase processing time:
  - **Barcode detection** may add several seconds per page
  - **Post-processing and enrichment** typically add **~10–20 seconds** on top of base latency
  - **Advanced passes** (dense tables, handwriting, annotations) may add **~10–25 seconds** per page
  - **Schema alignment and bounding boxes** can add additional processing time
- There are **no rate limits** — you can process as many pages as you want simultaneously.  
- Skew correction and other advanced passes may add a few seconds of processing time per page.

These are approximate numbers. For production workloads, we recommend uploading a sample batch to benchmark your own latency.
