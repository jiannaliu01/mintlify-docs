title: "JSON Extraction"
description: "Extract structured JSON from documents using Cardinal."
---

## Overview

Cardinal’s JSON mode lets you define the schema you want and receive structured data back. 

You provide the JSON shape, and Cardinal will attempt to align extracted values to it:

- Fields missing in the document will return **`null`**.  
- Fields not included in your schema are **ignored**.  
- Arrays are supported, though long PDFs may return partial arrays (see caveats below).

## Modes of JSON Extraction

We currently offer **two flavors of JSON extraction** depending on your use case:

### 1. Fast JSON — /extract (PDF only)

Use **Fast JSON** when you need a quick, lightweight response.  

- Best for short docs or targeted checks (e.g., “is this image blurry?”)
- Prioritizes speed over deep parsing
- Input: PDF via upload or fileUrl
- You must provide a schema

```json
{
  "is_blurry": true
}
```

### 2. Standard JSON — /process 

**Standard JSON** runs our full parsing pipeline and aligns output to your schema.

- Handles complex layouts (tables, annotations, etc.).
- Slower, but more reliable for production workloads.
- Input: PDF or image via upload or fileUrl
- Provide schema to receive schema_result

```json
{
  "invoice_number": "INV-00392",
  "due_date": "2025-09-01",
  "total_amount": 1042.50,
  "line_items": [
    {
      "description": "Consulting",
      "amount": 900.00
    },
    {
      "description": "Tax",
      "amount": 142.50
    }
  ]
}
``` 

### Long Document Caveats
Right now, **longer files may cause JSON extraction to break or truncate** (especially with large arrays).
We’re actively adding functionality to improve stability for multi-page and dense PDFs.

> 💡 If you hit issues with large files, you can paginate your PDF and run extraction page by page.

### Coming Soon

- Automatic chunking for long PDFs
