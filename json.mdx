title: "JSON Extraction"
description: "Extract structured JSON from documents using Cardinal."
---

## Overview

Cardinal's JSON mode lets you define the schema you want and receive structured data back. 

You provide the JSON shape, and Cardinal will attempt to align extracted values to it:

- Fields missing in the document will return **`null`**.  
- Fields not included in your schema are **ignored**.  
- Arrays are supported, though long PDFs may return partial arrays (see caveats below).

## Methods of JSON Extraction

We currently offer **two methods of JSON extraction** depending on your use case:

### 1. Fast JSON â€” /extract (PDF only)

Use **Fast JSON** when you need a quick, lightweight response with **lower cost and latency**.

- Best for short docs or targeted checks (e.g., "is this image blurry?")
- Prioritizes speed and cost-efficiency over deep parsing
- Input: PDF via upload or fileUrl
- You must provide a schema
```json
{
  "is_blurry": true
}
