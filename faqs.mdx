---

### What if I have a really big PDF?

Yes ‚Äî large PDFs are supported. You can upload via the **`/process`** endpoint using either:  
- **File upload** (`multipart/form-data`)  
- **File URL** (publicly accessible link)  

For very large files, we recommend using the `fileUrl` parameter so you don‚Äôt have to push hundreds of MBs over the wire.

---

### Where do results get stored?

By default, results are returned inline in the API response.  

---

### Do you support encrypted documents?

Yes ‚Äî Cardinal supports encrypted documents using the pycryptodome library. If you need support for an encryption method we don‚Äôt currently cover, reach out at team@trycardinal.ai.

---

### Is there a retry mechanism?

Yes. Failed pages are reported in the response (`failed_pages`). You can retry only those pages rather than re-processing the entire document.

---

### Can I add enrichment prompts or additional context?

Yes ‚Äî you can attach custom prompts or metadata for enrichment (currently in beta). For example, you can append descriptions to figures or map schema fields to your own ontology. This is especially useful in workflows like RAG or downstream classification.

If you‚Äôd like early access, contact us at team@trycardinal.ai.

---

### Do you handle flattened documents?

Yes. Even if the PDF is ‚Äúflattened‚Äù (text embedded on top of an image or scanned forms), Cardinal extracts the text + bounding boxes and re-aligns them. Some fidelity may be reduced depending on scan quality.

---

### What about really long documents?

Cardinal automatically chunks long files and processes them in parallel. This lets us handle **hundreds of pages** per document while keeping latency manageable.  

---

### What if I have traffic spikes?

We support **autoscaling**. Large bursts of documents are automatically distributed across workers, so you don‚Äôt need to manage scaling yourself.

---

### Can I just process a few pages?

Yes ‚Äî use the `start_page` and `end_page` parameters to limit extraction to a subset of the document.

---

### How does Classify / Split fit in?

Use **Classify & Split** (currently in beta) to pre-scan documents and tag pages by type (e.g., doctor‚Äôs notes, insurance forms, CRO docs). This is cheaper than full extraction and helps you decide which pages to process further.

### Why Markdown + JSON?

We chose **Markdown + JSON** because:  
- Markdown preserves document structure (tables, headings, annotations) while remaining lightweight and human-readable.  
- JSON provides schema-first outputs that map directly into downstream systems.  

### Why not XML?

XML is verbose and less developer-friendly. Markdown + JSON integrates more naturally with modern developer workflows (APIs, RAG, analytics) and avoids unnecessary complexity.
