### Tabular Summaries (coming soon)

Cardinal will soon support **Tabular Summaries**, giving you concise, table-formatted overviews of extracted data.  
This makes it easier to scan large documents, compare values, and get high-level insights without digging into the full JSON or Markdown output.  

---

### Figure Representation in Text (coming soon)

We’re adding the ability to represent **figures as plain text** — automatically converting images, charts, or diagrams into descriptive text.  
This way, you can capture the essence of figures without needing the raw image, making documents more searchable and lightweight.  

---

### Cache Layer (coming soon)

A **Cache Layer** is on the way, enabling faster responses for repeated requests and reducing processing time on large or frequently accessed documents.  
This will improve both latency and cost efficiency when working with high-volume workloads.  

<Note>
Stay tuned — all of these features are in development and will be available in upcoming releases!
