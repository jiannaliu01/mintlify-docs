title: "Signature Detection"
description: "Detect and extract signatures from documents, including signer metadata."
---

## Overview

Cardinal can automatically detect **signatures** within documents.  
For each detected signature, you'll receive:  

- **`signature_url`** – a cropped image of the detected signature.  
- **`is_signature`** – whether the region is confirmed to be a signature (`"yes"` or `"no"`).  
- **`signed_by`** – signer name.

---

## How to Enable

To enable signature detection, set `signatureDetect: true` in your API request.

- Default: `signatureDetect = false`  
- To **enable** signature detection, set `signatureDetect = true`.  
- ⚠️ Enabling signature detection will **add latency** to your requests, since additional detection passes are run.

## Example Response

```json
{
  "signatures": [
    {
      "is_signature": "yes",
      "signed_by": "Dr. John Doe",
      "signature_url": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

This enables use cases like:

- Verifying the presence of required signatures.
- Identifying who signed a document.
- Automating compliance workflows that require signature verification.

<Note> Signature detection is included in the JSON output alongside other extracted elements such as tables, barcodes, and figures. </Note>
