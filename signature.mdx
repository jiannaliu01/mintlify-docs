### Signature Detection

Cardinal can automatically detect **signatures** within documents.  
For each detected signature, you’ll receive:  

- **`signature_url`** – a cropped image of the detected signature.  
- **`is_signature`** – whether the region is confirmed to be a signature (`"yes"` or `"no"`).  
- **`signed_by`** – signer name.

---

### Post-Processing

Signature detection requires **post-processing** to be enabled.  

- Default: `post_processing_on = false`  
- To **enable** signature detection (and other advanced passes), set `post_processing_on = true`.  
- ⚠️ Enabling post-processing will **add latency** to your requests, since additional detection passes are run.

### Example Response (excerpt)

```json
{
  "signatures": [
    {
      "is_signature": "yes",
      "signed_by": "Dr. John Doe",
      "signature_url": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

This enables use cases like:

- Verifying the presence of required signatures.
- Identifying who signed a document.
- Automating compliance workflows that require signature verification.

<Note> Signature detection is included in the JSON output alongside other extracted elements such as tables, barcodes, and figures. </Note>
