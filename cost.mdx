### Cost & Pricing

Cardinal uses a **tiered pricing model** based on credits.  
See full details on our [Pricing Page](https://trycardinal.ai/pricing).  

Each plan includes a set number of credits per month, with higher tiers offering lower per-page cost and more volume.  

---

### How Credits Work

- **1 credit ≈ 1 page** of standard PDF or image extraction.  
- **Complex documents** (dense tables, multi-column layouts, images, annotations) may consume **slightly more credits**.  
- **Lightweight tasks** (e.g., classify/split runs, metadata-only checks) may consume **fewer credits**.  
- **Batch uploads** are billed per page, so a 300-page PDF = ~300 credits.  

This ensures you only pay for the actual work required — heavier pages cost more, lighter pages cost less.

### Examples

- A simple text-only 2-page invoice → **~2 credits**.  
- A 10-page construction spec with dozens of tiny tables → **~12–15 credits** (slightly higher due to table processing).  
- A 50-page mixed medical record, classified first to isolate 10 pages of doctor’s notes → **~10 credits for classification + 10 credits for extraction**, instead of processing all 50.

### Why Credits?

Credits make billing **predictable and flexible**:  
- Scale up or down by plan tier.  
- Handle a mix of light and heavy documents without surprise overages.  
- Only pay for the work your documents actually need.
