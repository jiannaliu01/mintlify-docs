subtitle: Learn how to authenticate your requests to the Cardinal API

## Overview

The Cardinal API uses an **API key passed via the `x-api-key` header** for all requests.  
Every request must include your API key or it will be rejected.

## Obtaining an API Key

1. Log into the [Cardinal Dashboard](https://dashboard.cardinal.ai)  
2. Navigate to **Settings â†’ API Keys**  
3. Create a new API key or copy an existing one  

**Important**: Keep your API keys secure. Do not share them publicly, and rotate them regularly. If a key is compromised, revoke it immediately from the dashboard.

## Making Authenticated Requests

### HTTP Header Format

Include your API key in the request headers:

```bash
x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>
