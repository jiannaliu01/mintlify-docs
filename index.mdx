> Cardinal transforms messy PDFs, images, and scanned files into structured, reliable data you can use immediately. From JSON extraction to RAG pipelines, Cardinal gives you the building blocks to automate document processing without constraints.  

<Tip>
**The next generation of Cardinal**  

- **Schema-first JSON Extraction** – Provide your schema, and Cardinal maps data into it automatically.
- **Rich Tables & Annotations** – Accurately capture spanning tables, checkmarks, barcodes, signatures, and image metadata — all built in, no hacks required.  
- **Flexible Output Modes** – Get high fidelity Markdown. Add bounding boxes to power downstream RAG and human review.
