title: "Image Metadata"
description: "Extract image references and metadata alongside Markdown output."

## Overview

When Cardinal extracts figures and images, the Markdown output now contains **numbered placeholders** like:

```markdown
Here is a chart of quarterly revenue: [Figure 1]
```

These placeholders are not expanded in the Markdown itself.

Instead, the corresponding metadata is provided separately in the `image_metadata` field of the API response.

## How It Works

- **Markdown output**: contains `[Figure N]` placeholders (e.g., `[Figure 1]`, `[Figure 2]`)
- **API response**: contains an `image_metadata` array with entries that match those placeholders by ID

Each `image_metadata` entry includes:

- `figure_id` — numeric ID that matches the Markdown placeholder
- `caption` — short description or label for the figure
- `cropped_image_url` — direct link to the cropped figure image
- `metadata` — additional context (format, description, brand info, etc.)
- `bounding_box` — both original and pixel coordinates of the figure
- `subfigure_count` — number of subfigures (if any)
- `processing_times` — timing breakdown of how long each step took

> **Note**: By default, `cropped_image_url` contains temporary URLs to the extracted images. To prevent URL generation and keep images ephemeral, set the `ephemeral: true` flag in your API request.

## Example

### Markdown Output

```markdown
Revenue grew steadily across the quarter: [figure 1]
```

### API Response
