title: "Image Metadata"
description: "Extract image references and metadata alongside Markdown output."
---

## Overview

When Cardinal extracts figures and images, the Markdown output contains **lightweight placeholders** like:

```markdown
Here is a chart of quarterly revenue: <figure1>
```

These placeholders are not expanded in the Markdown itself.

Instead, the corresponding metadata is provided separately in the image_metadata field of the API response.

---

## How It Works

- **Markdown output**: contains <figureN> tags (e.g., <figure1>, <figure2>)
- **API response**: contains an image_metadata array with entries that match those placeholders by name

Each image_metadata entry includes:
- name → matches the placeholder in Markdown (figure1, figure2, …)
- image_url → direct link to the cropped figure image
- bounding_box → coordinates of the figure in the page
- metadata → additional properties (format, size, caption, etc.)

---

## Example

### Markdown Output
```markdown
Revenue grew steadily across the quarter: <figure1>
```
 
### API Response 
```json 
{
  "pages": [
    {
      "content": "Revenue grew steadily across the quarter: <figure1>",
      "image_metadata": [
        {
          "name": "figure1",
          "image_url": "https://cdn.trycardinal.ai/tmp/fig-1.png",
          "bounding_box": {
            "x": 100,
            "y": 200,
            "width": 400,
            "height": 300
          },
          "metadata": {
            "format": "png",
            "size": { "width": 800, "height": 600 },
            "caption": "Quarterly revenue trend"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Use Cases

- Render figures inline by replacing <figureN> with the associated image_url
- Preserve document flow while separating text and visuals cleanly
- Enable interactive UIs (hover over <figure1> → show chart preview)
