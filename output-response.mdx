## Overview

Every Cardinal API call returns a **JSON response**.  
The baseline structure is consistent, but additional fields may appear depending on which flags you enable (e.g., schema extraction, bounding boxes, image metadata).

---

## Successful Response

**HTTP 200 — application/json**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "total_pages": 2,
  "successful_pages": 2,
  "failed_pages": 0,
  "pages": [
    {
      "content": "ACME CORPORATION\nInvoice #INV-2024-001\n...",
      "height": 792,
      "width": 612,
      "barcodes": [],
      "bounding_boxes": [],
      "signatures": [],
      "image_metadata": [],
      "processed_tables": []
    }
  ],
  "schema_result": {
    "invoiceNumber": "250339",
    "dueDate": "2025-04-18"
  }
}
```

## Top-level fields

- success (boolean) — Whether the request completed successfully.
- total_pages (integer) — Total number of pages processed.
- successful_pages (integer) — Count of pages processed without error.
- failed_pages (integer) — Count of pages that failed.
- pages (array) — Page-by-page extraction results (Markdown + metadata).
- schema_result (object, optional) — Only present if you provided a schema. Contains structured extraction aligned to your schema.

## Pagination

Large documents are **paginated into responses of ~100 pages each.**

Each response chunk contains the same schema (success, total_pages, pages, etc.).

You can combine results client-side to reconstruct full documents.

## Errors

Non-200 responses indicate failure:
- 400 — Bad request (invalid input or missing parameters)
- 401 — Unauthorized (invalid or missing API key)
- 415 — Unsupported media type
- 500 — Internal server error (processing failed)

Error responses include a message describing the issue.

## Cost Tracking

Like Gemini and other providers, Cardinal will also support returning how many credits were consumed in the response.
