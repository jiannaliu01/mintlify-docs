## Overview

Cardinal can convert PDFs and images into **clean, structured Markdown**.  
This mode is built on the `/process` endpoint and is the default output format.

- **Tables** are returned in **HTML** by default (to preserve complex structure).  
- If you set **`markdown: true`**, tables are also converted to Markdown using the `markdownify` library.  
  - ⚠️ **Warning:** Markdown tables may lose fidelity — complex spanning cells, merged rows, or nested tables are often degraded.

## Coverage

When converting to Markdown, Cardinal handles:

- ✅ **Annotations**  
- ✅ **Checkmarks**  
- ✅ **Spanning tables** (row/column merges)  
- ✅ **Complex tables** (multi-level, nested)  

All of these are preserved in the Markdown/HTML output.
