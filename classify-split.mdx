### Classify & Split

Cardinal supports a **lightweight page classification mode** that scans each page to assign metadata and categories **without running full extraction**.  

This is useful when your files contain **mixed document types** (e.g., doctor’s notes + insurance forms all in one PDF).  

Instead of extracting everything, you can first **classify pages**, then choose which ones to fully process.  

---

### Benefits

- **Lower credit usage** – classification is cheaper than full extraction.  
- **Flexible metadata** – define any categories you need (`"DoctorNotes"`, `"Insurance"`, `"CRO"`, etc.).  
- **Selective processing** – only run full extraction on the pages that matter.  
- **Automatic splitting** – optionally split large PDFs into smaller files by category.  

---

### Example Use Cases

- **Healthcare** – separate doctor’s notes from billing pages.  
- **Insurance** – distinguish between claim forms, ID cards, and policy documents.  
- **Life Sciences / CRO** – extract only CRO-related documents.  
- **General** – pre-sort mixed uploads and save credits by ignoring irrelevant pages.

<Note>
**Beta:** Want to use it? Email **team@trycardinal.ai** — **Classify & Split** is currently in beta.  
It runs as a **pre-pass** that consumes fewer credits than full extraction and helps decide which pages to process further.
